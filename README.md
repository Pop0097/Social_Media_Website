Popper is a social media platform that I developed during Spring 2020. I created this program to understand the logic behind social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. I used Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS to develop the software.

Popper brings forth many valuable features such as:
- unique user accounts protected by a password
- - ADD TO THIS LIST - -


This version uses Ruby version 2.6.3 and Rails 6.0.2.2


Deployment of software:
You must have rails installed. To do so, follow the steps as outlined on this website: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html

In addition to rails, you will need to have access to other gems:
- - ADD TO THIS LIST - -

Afterwards, access ~/Social_Media_Website and enter "$ rails server"

On a web browser, go to "localhost:3000". You will see the home page of the website. Navigate as you please.
