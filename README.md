# README

Popper is a social media platform that I developed during Spring 2020. I created this program to understand the logic behind social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. I used Ruby on Rails, HTML, and SCSS (superset of CSS) to develop the software.

Popper brings forth many valuable features such as:
- Unique user accounts protected by a username/email and a password
- Ability to share images
- Ability to like and comment on posts
- Ability to follow other users

This version uses Ruby version 2.6.3 and Rails 6.0.2.2



Deployment of software:
You must have rails installed. To do so, follow Step 3.1 in the following website: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html

In addition to rails, you will need to have access to these gems:
- devise (this program uses version 4.7.1)
- carrierwave (this program uses version 2.0)
- mini_magick (this program uses version 4.10.1)
- will_paginate (this program uses version 3.1.8)

You can download these gems at https://rubygems.org. Note that your computer may require additional steps to install these gems. 

Download this repository on your computer, access ~/Social_Media_Website and enter "$ rails server"

On a web browser, go to "http://localhost:3000". You will see the home page of the website. Navigate as you please.
